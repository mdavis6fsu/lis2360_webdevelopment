*ENTER YOUR RESPONSE AFTER THIS STATEMENT:*

Firstly, one of my favorite sites is probably one I use way too often, www.facebook.com.  This website allows me to keep in touch with my family in Pensacola, friends from all over the world, keep me update on news, inform me of a sale at my favorite retail store, and so much more.  Another website that is a favorite is www.msn.com because it allows me to customize the news I would like to see, allows easy access to my email, and gives me up-to-date financial information.
The graphics in both of these popular websites are very modern and user friendly.  The color scheme of Facebook is generally consistent in order to keep things familiar with the constant updates to features.  It think that Facebook blue is actually a color and easily recognizable.  Since most of the graphics that appear on this page are ads or pictures shared from my friends, it changes everyday and there is always something new to see.  I would like to understand the algorithm a little more maybe.
The graphics for msn.com also change daily depending on what is going on in the world and what product paid to get your attention to click on their ad.  The page  is always moving, providing as much information as possible and more at the click of the mouse.  I can easily access my favorite, most visited websites, find out the weather.  The graphics are efficient and keep everything easy to find.  The colors of the webpage are bright and eye catching.

## Question #2:  Comparing Website Features and Content
Briefly discuss the five critical web development issues mentioned in your textbook: 
1. Users and Usability
2. Cross-browser compatibility
3. User accessiblity 
4. Search engine optimization
5. Responsive Web Design (RWD)

*ENTER YOUR RESPONSE AFTER THIS STATEMENT:*

There are five critical web development issues.  The first of these is (1) User and Usability which allows users to find exactly what they are looking for as quickly as possible.  Important features to make the website effective include presenting as much information as possible "above the fold" so the user can scroll less.  Limit groups on each page and group related items together.  Have a header that includes a navigation bar and links.  Also, having a logo that can easily take you directly to the home page.
(2)Cross-browser compatibility which means your web page is compatibile with multiple browsers in order to make your website easy to access on multiple devices.  Learn the work arounds for common problems with certain browsers and test your website so you are aware of any incompatibility.
(3) User accessiblity is trying to make your website accessible to as many users as possible. Taking into consideration those with disabilities.
(4)Search engine optimization to rank your website high in search engines. 
(5)Responsive web design refers to the adaptability to the screen size trying to load the website. Making the look and feel of the website consistant with the screen size.

I have always thought that cybersecurity and cybercrime is very interesting.  It is comforting to see that the protection against these types of crime definitely makes it a harder effort to attempt.  There will always be those willing to try. I can totally imagine how crippling society would be by an Internet War as opposed to a traditional war.  Shutting down our transportation and water supply alone would be devastating.  
The Internet Encryption and Public Keys was very interesting to learn about the Ceasar’s Cipher.  Decryption sounds like a huge puzzle.  Asymmetric Decryption, Public Key Cryptology, SSL, and TSL are important to be aware of when sharing private information over the computer.   I can see that we are getting better but so are our computers and that leaves us with a huge challenge to stay ahead in order to keep private information safe.
Search Engine Optimization is a thing.  I guess I didn’t realize that there was a way to strategically make sure that your website was seen first other than paying for an ad.  It will be interesting to learn what coding techniques will help websites be easier to access in search engines.  It is a fact that most people do not look past the first page of choices in a search engine and I can see how this would make or break a business when designing a web page.
